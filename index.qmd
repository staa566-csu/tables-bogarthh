## Summary

The lending data comes from 5 years of investment in a crowd-lending platform, the purpuse of creating this tables is to have a scorecard to decide how to invest based on real data of the of the credit's behavior classified by the Credit Score.

The Credit Score can be A for a person who has a very good credit history in the Mexican Bureau of Credit, to G being the lower score. Of course, credits with better score have a lower interest rate. This game is about manage the risk.

## R Code

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(gt)



lending <- read_csv('lending.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)



lending$capital_int <- lending$interes_p+lending$interes_m+lending$capital_p

#grouping by score


lending_t1 <- lending %>% filter(year <= 2019 & status %in% c("PAGADO","LIBERADO"))   %>% select( score, amt_inv, interes_rate, capital_p,  capital_int) %>% group_by(score) %>% summarise(credits=n(), interest_avg =mean(interes_rate),ammount_inv=sum(amt_inv), cap_int =sum(capital_int)) %>% dplyr::mutate(profit_pct =  cap_int/ ammount_inv - 1) %>% gt()
